# Bubble Sort Visualizer  https://bubblesort-visualizer.netlify.app/

This project is a simple bubble sort visualizer that demonstrates the sorting algorithm by animating bars in a vertical layout.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the "Start" button to visualize the bubble sort algorithm.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for implementing the bubble sort algorithm and animations.

## Components

### `index.html`

- Defines the structure of the webpage.
- Includes the "Start" button to trigger the bubble sort visualization.
  
### `style.css`

- Contains the styling rules for the webpage.
- Defines the appearance of the parent container, bars, and the "Start" button.

### `script.js`

- Implements the bubble sort algorithm and animations.
- Defines functions for swapping bars, changing colors and heights, and triggering the visualization.

## Functionality

- The bars represent elements to be sorted.
- The "Start" button triggers the bubble sort visualization.
- Bars are animated to demonstrate the sorting process.

## Customization

You can customize the initial array, animation speed, and other parameters by modifying the `arr` array and adjusting the sleep durations in the JavaScript code.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your preferences and learning purposes.

Enjoy the visualization!
